## 🧩 What Is WorkProof?

**WorkProof** is a smart, agent-powered freelancing platform built for the **Web3 era**. It ensures freelancers **never get ghosted** and clients only pay when they receive **quality work**. All this is secured by on-chain escrow, AI-powered task validation, and Coinbase’s CDP ecosystem.

> ✨ Real work. Real protection. Real fast payments.

## 🎥 Walkthrough

1. Client posts a task and deposits bounty funds.
2. Freelancer accepts the task, completes it, and submits files.
3. Submission is reviewed by **Coinbase Agent AI Validator** (via Akash).
4. If approved, funds are instantly released using **x402** transactions.
5. Files are stored on **IPFS** via Pinata and fully visible to the client.
6. Small fees are collected for platform scaling via CDP logic.
